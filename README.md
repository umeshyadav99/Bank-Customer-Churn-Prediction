We aim to accomplist the following for this problem:

1.Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn:

2.Build a prediction model that will perform the following:

    a.Classify if a customer is going to churn or not
    b.Preferably and based on model performance, choose a model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target low hanging fruits in       their efforts to prevent churn
